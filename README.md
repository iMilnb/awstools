# awstools

This repository contains tools I wrote to play with AWS

At `${DAYWORK}`, we use *Amazon Web Services* more and more, so I naturally
began writing tools to automate its manipulation.

I'll slowly free parts that are not bound to our own infrastructure in this
repository. The modules and scripts I wrote mainly use [boto3][1] and
[troposphere][2], please check those two fabulous projects out!
